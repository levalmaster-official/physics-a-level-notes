#### Projectiles
A projectile is a particle moving freely (it is non-powered) under gravity, in a two dimensional plane.
- Examples include throwing a ball, jumping off a diving board or launching a cannon.

An object is sent into a projectile motion trajectory with a resultant velocity, $u$ at an angle, $\theta$ to the horizontal.

- The range is the horizontal distance travelled by the projectile
- The maximum height is when the projectile is at rest ($v = 0$).

##### Horizontal and vertical directions
- The trajectory of an object undergoing projectile motion consists of forces in a horizontal and a vertical direction.
- These quantities are independent of each other, and thus displacement, velocity and acceleration are all vector quantities that are different in both components.


| SUVAT        | Horizontal component | Vertical component                                    |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Velocity     | Constant             | Changing (0 at maximum height)                        |
| Acceleration | 0                    | Acceleration due to gravity, $-9.81 \text{ m s}^{-2}$ |

#### Friction
Any object moving through the air experiences **air resistance** which creates a force of **drag**
- This is caused by friction between the air molecules and the object
- Its horizontal component reduces its horizontal velocity and its range
- Its vertical component reduces its maximum height and causes a steeper gradient as it falls back to earth
- A projectile with air resistance travels a smaller distance and has a lower maximum height than one without air resistance

##### Drag
Drag forces are forces that act in the **opposite direction** to the direction of motion of the object through a fluid.
- A fluid is a term used in describe a liquid or a gas.
- Drag does work on an object's kinetic energy and converts it into heat and sound.
Freefall is the state in which the only force acting on an object is the gravitational force.

> [!NOTE] Factors affecting drag
> - An object with a larger surface area will experience greater drag
 >- An object with a greater velocity will experience greater drag
 >- An object moving in a **fluid** with higher velocity will experience greater drag
 
##### Lift
Lift is an upwards force on an object moving through a fluid. It is perpendicular to the fluid flow. It is always in the opposite direction to the weight.

- For example, as an aeroplane moves through the air, it pushes down on the air to change its direction
- This causes an equal and opposite reaction upwards on the wings (lift) due to Newton's third law
#### Terminal velocity
- For a body in free fall, the only force acting is its weight and its acceleration $g$ is only due to gravity.
- The drag force increases as the body accelerates
    - This increase in velocity means the drag force also increases

![[Pasted image 20241205041757.png| centre | 500]]

- Due to Newton’s Second Law, this means the resultant force and therefore acceleration decreases (recall $F= ma$)
- When the drag force is equal to the gravitational pull on the body, the body will no longer accelerate and will fall at a constant velocity
    - This the **maximum** velocity that the object can have and is called the **terminal velocity**
