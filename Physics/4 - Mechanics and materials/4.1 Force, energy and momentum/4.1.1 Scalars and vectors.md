#### Scalars and vectors
Scalars are quantities that have **magnitude** but not direction. For example, mass is a scalar quantity.

Vectors are quantities that have both **magnitude** and **direction**. For example, weight is a vector quantity because it is a force and has both magnitude and direction.

##### Examples of scalars and vectors

| **Scalars** | **Vectors**  |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| distance    | displacement |
| speed       | velocity     |
| mass        | acceleration |
| time        | force        |
| energy      | momentum     |
###### Distance and displacement

> [!TLDR] Displacement is a vector quantity while distance is a scalar quantity
> - Distance is a measure of how far an object has travelled. It is the total length of the path taken and has no direction. Therefore it is a scalar quantity.
> - Displacement is a measure of how far it is between two points in space, including the direction. It is a vector quantity.
###### Velocity and speed

> [!TLDR] Velocity is a vector quantity while speed is a scalar quantity
>- Speed is a measure of the distance travelled by an object per unit time, so speed is a scalar quantity.
> - Velocity is a measure of the displacement of an object per unit time, so velocity is a vector quantity.
#### Combining vectors

Vectors are represented by an arrow
- The arrowhead indicates the direction of the vector
- The length of the arrow represents the magnitude

Vectors can be combined by adding them to produce the resultant vector. The resultant vector is the net force experienced.


> [!NOTE] Combining vectors
> - Pythagoras' Theorem can be used to find the magnitude of the resultant vector.
> - Trigonometry can be used to find the direction of the resultant vector.
> - A scale drawing can also be used for addition

#### Resolving vectors
Resolving a vector is representing a single resultant vector by two vectors (usually at right angles to one another), which in combination have the same effect as the original. It is the opposite of [[#Combining vectors|combining vectors]].

- When a single resultant vector is broken down into its parts, those parts are called **components**
##### Equilibrium
Forces are in equilibrium when the resultant force is 0. This means that the object is either:
1. At rest
2. Moving at a constant velocity

Coplanar forces are forces which act on the same plane. They can be represented by vector triangles.

> [!INFO] Equilibrium on a free-body diagram
> In equilibrium, coplanar forces are represented by closed vector triangles.
> - The addition of the vectors end up at the starting position.
