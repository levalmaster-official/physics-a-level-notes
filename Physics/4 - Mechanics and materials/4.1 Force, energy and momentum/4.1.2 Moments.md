Specification reference: [[AQA Physics Specification#4.1.2 Moments|4.1.2 Moments]]

A moment is the turning effect of a force. Moments occur when forces cause rotational motion, i.e. when forces cause objects to rotate around some pivot.

>[!QUOTE] A moment is the product of the force and the perpendicular distance from the point to the line of action of the force

The moment of a force is given by:
$$
\text{Moment } (N m) = \text{force } (N) \times \text{perpendicular distance from the pivot } (m)
$$
The line of action is a straight line along which a force acts. It passes through the point where the force is applied and extends in the same direction as the force.

#### Couple moments

>[!QUOTE] A couple is defined as two equal coplanar forces acting in opposite directions

A couple produces pure rotational motion. It produces no translational motion, since the resultant force is 0. Couples must consist of [[4.1.1 Scalars and vectors#Equilibrium|coplanar]] forces.
#### Principle of moments

>[!QUOTE] The principle of moments states that for an object in rotational equilibrium, the sum of the clockwise moments about a pivot is equal to the sum of anticlockwise moments

The principle of moments can be described as follows:
$$
\sum \text{clockwise moments} = \sum \text{anticlockwise moments}
$$
#### Centre of mass

>[!QUOTE] The centre of mass of an object is the point at which an object's mass acts.

The weight of an object acts on the centre of mass. If a regular object is described as uniform in density, its centre of mass will be exactly at its centre.

Due to this property, if a single force acts through the point of the centre of mass, no turning effect is produced.

Therefore, it is possible to identify the centre of mass for an irregularly shaped object as follows:
1. Take the object and hang it from a  fixed point next to a plum line
2. Draw a straight line where the plum line touches the object
3. Repeat this by hanging the object from another point. The centre of mass is where the lines intersect.
