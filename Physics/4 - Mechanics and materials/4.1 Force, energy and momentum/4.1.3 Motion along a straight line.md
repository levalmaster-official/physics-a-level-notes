#### Velocity and acceleration
Speed is the rate of change in distance and is a scalar quantity. Velocity is the rate of change in displacement, and is a vector.

$$\text{Velocity } (v) = \frac{\text{change in displacement}}{\text{time}} = \frac{{\Delta s}}{\Delta t}$$
**Acceleration** is the rate of change of velocity of an object.
$$\text{Acceleration } (a) = \frac{\text{change in velocity}}{\text{time}} = \frac{{\Delta v}}{\Delta t}$$
#### Average and instantaneous velocity
The instantaneous velocity is the velocity of an object at a given point in time.
- This could be where an object is moving at a constant velocity or accelerating (a changing velocity).
- To find the instantaneous velocity, a tangent can be drawn on a displacement-time graph. The gradient of the tangent is equal to the velocity at that point.

The average velocity is the total displacement divided by the total time.
- To calculate this, all that must be known is the displacement and the time.
#### Uniform and non-uniform acceleration graphs
##### Displacement-time graph
- The gradient equals the velocity
- The y-intercept is the initial displacement

##### Velocity-time graph
- The gradient equals the acceleration
- The y-intercept is the initial velocity
- A straight line represents uniform acceleration
- The area under the curve equals the displacement travelled

##### Acceleration-time graph
- The y-intercept is the initial acceleration
- A horizontal line represents an object with constant acceleration
- The area under the curve equals the change in velocity

#### Equations of motion for uniform acceleration
These equations are commonly known as SUVAT equations. They are used for objects in constant acceleration, for example, a falling object. They contain the following variables:
- $s$ = displacement ($\text{m}$)
- $u$ = initial velocity ($\text{m s}^{-1}$)
- $v$ = final velocity ($\text{m s}^{-1}$)
- $a$ = acceleration ($\text{m s}^{-2}$)
- $t$ = time ($\text{s}$)
$$
\begin{aligned}
v &= u + at \\[3mm]
s &= ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2 \\[3mm]
s &= \frac{{u+t}}{2}t \\[3mm]
v^2 &= u^2 + 2as
\end{aligned}
$$
If an object begins at rest, then $u =0$ when $t=0$. If an object is falling due to gravity, then $a = g = -9.81 \text{ m s}^{-2}$.
