An electrical circuit requires a conductor through which current can flow, and a source of potential difference. Conductors have a high number density of charge carriers. Potential difference describes the energy per unit of charge.

### Charge

Charge is the basis of current. Electric charge ($Q$) is a fundamental property of matter, which can be either positive or negative. Its unit is the coulomb (C).

Current is due to the passage of charged particles, referred to as charge carriers. In metals, these are electrons ($e^{-}$). A single electron has the charge of $-1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ C, which is equal to one [[1.1 Use of SI units and their prefixes#Electron volt (eV)|electron-volt]] divided by 1 volt ($E=\frac{Q}{V}$). Therefore, there a charge of 1 coulomb is provided by $\frac{1}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} = 6.25 \times 10^{18}$ electrons. 

Kirchkoff's first law states that all current entering junction leaves the junction. Charge is conserved for a circuit. This is the principle of conservation of mass.
### Current
>[!QUOTE] The electric current is the rate of flow of charge in the wire or component.

Current can be described with the following equation:
$$
I = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}
$$
where $I$ is current (measured in amperes, A), $\Delta Q$ is the charge flow (measured in coulombs, C) and $\Delta t$ is the time elapsed (s).

Current can be measured using an ammeter. Ammeters must be connected in series with the component being measured.

>[!INFO] Conventions :(
>The convention for the direction of current in a circuit is from positive (+) to negative (-). However, in reality, electrons leave from the negative terminal as they are attracted and move towards the positive terminal of a battery
### Potential difference
A battery has the **potential** to transfer energy from its chemical store to electrons which deliver energy to the torch bulb. Each electron moves around the circuit and takes a fixed amount of energy from the battery as it passes through and passes it through a circuit.

The potential difference, or voltage, is the energy transferred per unit charge as the charge moves through a component or circuit. It is the *fixed amount of energy* taken by the electrons. The energy per unit charge taken up is known as the [[5.1.6 Electromotive force and internal resistance|electromotive force]].

>[!quote] Potential difference is defined as the work done per unit charge

Potential difference can be described using the following equation:
$$
V =\frac{W}{Q}
$$
where $V$ is potential difference (measured in volts, V), $W$ is the work done (measured in joules, J) and $Q$ is the charge flow (measured in coulombs, C). Therefore, the unit for voltage in [[1.1 Use of SI units and their prefixes#SI units|base SI units]] is $\text{JC}^{-1}$.

Potential difference is measured using a voltmeter. Voltmeter must be set up in parallel with the component being measured.

Kirchkoff's second law states that the energy provided for a circuit is the same as the energy lost, and so the sum of the EMF (energy taken up by electrons at the battery) is the sum of the potential differences (energy lost by the electrons at a component). This is the principle of the conservation of energy, and applies to an **ideal** circuit, that is, one with zero resistance.

>[!info] How are potential differences made?
>A simple cell creates a potential difference through the separation of charge. One end (terminal) has an excess of positive charge and the other an excess of negative charge.
### Resistance
Resistance is defined as the opposition of a component to the flow of electric current through it. It is described using the following equation:
$$
R = \frac{V}{I}
$$
where $R$ is resistance (measured in ohms, $\Omega$), $V$ is potential difference (measured in volts, V) and $I$ is current (measured in amperes, A).

Resistance is caused by collisions between the charged carrying electrons and the atoms or ions for the substance it is travelling through. These collisions cause the conductor to heat up as the ions gain kinetic energy and vibrate faster.  As the conductor heats up, the faster moving ions oppose the flow of charge more, so the resistance increases further.

Ohm's law states that $V \propto I$ provided that the temperature remains constant.

For a given potential difference:
- the higher the resistance, the lower the current that can flow
- the lower the resistance, the higher the current that can flow
