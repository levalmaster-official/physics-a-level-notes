#### Orders of magnitude
When a number is expressed in standard form, the power of 10 is its order of magnitude. For example, the order of magnitude of $3 \times 10^8$ is just $10^8$ .

Orders of magnitude follow rules for rounding. 
- The order of magnitude for $7 \times 10^8$ is $10^9$ .

A quantity is an **order of magnitude larger** than another quantity if it is about **ten times larger** Similarly, **two orders of magnitude** would be **100 times larger,** or $10^2$.
