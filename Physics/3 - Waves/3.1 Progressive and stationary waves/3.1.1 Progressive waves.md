Specification reference: [[AQA Physics Specification#3.1.1 Progressive waves|3.1.1 Progressive waves]]

A progressive wave transfers energy without transferring material and is made up of particles of a medium (or field) oscillating.

- Amplitude -  the maximum displacement of a wave from the equilibrium position
- Displacement - the distance and direction of a vibrating particle from its equilibrium position
- Equilibrium position - the position of the wave when no energy is being transferred through it
- Frequency (f) - the number of complete oscillations passing through a point per second (Hz)
- Wavelength (λ) - the shortest distance between two consecutive points on wave with the same gradient and amplitude (i.e. two consecutive points on wave that are in phase)
- Wave cycle - one complete vibration of a wave, from a point of maximum displacement to the next point of maximum displacement
- Speed (c) - distance travelled by the wave per unit time (m/s)
- Period (T) - time taken for one full oscillation of a wave (s)

Speed and frequency
$$\text{Speed} = \text{frequency} \times \text{wavelength} = c = f \lambda$$
 $$\text{Frequency} = \frac{1}{\text{Time period}}$$
#### Phase difference
- Phase - the fraction of a cycle a vibrating particle has completed since the start of the cycle, which is a measurement of the position of a point along the wave cycle (rad, deg)

> [!INFO] Phase and antiphase
> - Two points on a wave are in **phase** if they are both at the same point of the wave cycle, they will have the same displacement, velocity, and frequency. Their phase difference will be a multiple of 360º. They do not need to have the same amplitude (e.g. if they are points on *different* waves).
> - Two points are in **antiphase** (completely out of phase) when they are an odd integer multiple of 180º.

- Phase difference - the fraction of a cycle between the vibrations of two particles, measured in either degrees or radians, where 1 cycle = 360° = 2π, i.e. the amount of one wave lags behind another
$$\text{Phase difference} = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \times \text{path difference}$$

Radians
- Radian - a unit of angular measurement defined by the radius of a circle
- Specifically, one radian is the angle formed when the arc length on a circle is equal to the radius of that circle

#### Reflection and refraction
- Reflection is where a wave is *bounced back* after it hits a boundary. The reflection of water waves can be observed by the wave fronts in a ripple tank or using a light ray and a plane mirror. The angle between the incident ray and the mirror is equal to the angle between the reflected ray and the mirror

- Refraction is when a wave changes direction as it enters a different medium. The change in direction is a result of the wave slowing down or speeding up
