Specification reference: [[AQA Physics Specification#3.1.3 Principle of superposition of waves and formation of stationary waves|3.1.3 Principle of superposition of waves and formation of stationary waves]]

Waves **superpose** when they meet, combining for an instant, and either constructive or destructive interference occurs.

> [!NOTE] The principle of superposition
> When two or more waves of the same type meet in one place, the total displacement at a point is equal to the vector sum of the individual displacements at that point

[[3.1.3(b) Formation of stationary waves#Stationary waves|Stationary waves]], [[3.2.1(a) Interference|interference]] and [[3.2.2 Diffraction|diffraction]] are all phenomena produced by superposition of waves.
