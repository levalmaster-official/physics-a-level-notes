#### Transverse and longitudinal waves
- Transverse waves - oscillation of particles (or fields) is at right angles to the direction of [[3.1.1 Progressive waves|energy transfer]]
	- All electromagnetic (EM) waves are transverse, and travel at $3 \times 10^8 \text{ ms}^{-1}$ in a vacuum. They oscillate in all directions unless polarised

- Longitudinal waves - where the oscillation of particles Is parallel to the direction of energy transfer
	- They are made up of compressions and rarefractions and cannot transfer in a vacuum
	- Mechanical waves are waves that require a medium to propagate, but there is no net movement of the medium that carried the wave

#### Polarisation
- A polarised wave oscillates in only one plane.
- Polarisation is the action of restricting the vibrations of a transverse wave to a single direction or plane
- There are two types of polarisation: vertical plane polarisation and horizontal plane polarisation.
- Only transverse waves can be polarised because polarisation requires the wave's oscillation to be perpendicular to its direction of travel. Thus polarisation provides evidence for the nature of transverse waves as having its oscillation perpendicular to the direction of energy of propagation.

Light can be polarised in 4 different ways:
1. Polaroid filter
2. [[3.1.1 Progressive waves#Reflection and refraction|Reflection]] from non-metallic surfaces, e.g. water and asphalt
3. [[3.1.1 Progressive waves#Reflection and refraction|Refraction]]
4. Scattering


> [!INFO] How polaroid filters work
> Ordinary light consists of vibrations in many different planes. The filter only allows through electric field oscillations in a single plane, absorbing the energy from oscillations in all other planes, like waves on a rope passing through a slit

##### What does polarisation show about light?
Only transverse waves can be polarised. Longitudinal waves cannot be polarised because the particles in the wave vibrate in the same direction as the wave travels. Polarisation shows that transverse waves have multiple planes of oscillation.

##### Applications of polarisation
- Polaroid sunglasses - reduce glare by blocking partially polarised light reflect from water and tarmac, as they only allow oscillations in the plane of the filter, making it easier to see

> [!QUESTION] How do polaroid sunglasses work?
> Polaroid sunglasses reduce glare by blocking partially plane polarised light from water and tarmac (the reflected light oscillates more in the horizontal plane than in the vertical plane), as they only allow oscillations in the vertical plane of the filter. This means that submerged objects can be seen as the reflected light is not blocking the light from under the surface

- TV and radio signals, which are plane-polarised by the orientation of the rods on the transmitting aerial, so the receiving aerial must be aligned in the same plane of polarisation to receive the signal at full strength
- Stress analysis - reveals areas of high and low stress
- LCD analysis - very low power
- 3D glasses - enhancing view experience
- Polarimeter - to analyse chemicals / concentration or type of sugar
