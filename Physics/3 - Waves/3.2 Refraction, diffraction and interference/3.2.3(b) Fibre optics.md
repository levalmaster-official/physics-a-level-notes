#### Optical fibres
Optical fibres are long, solid cylinders of glass or a transparent polymer (plastic). A single fibre has a very small diameter (typically ) 15Âµm for a single fibre. Cables are made of many such fibres.

- [[3.2.3(a) Refraction at a plane surface#Total internal reflection|Total internal reflection]] is used to reflect light along optical fibres
- Light, that is normally monochromatic, [[3.2.3(a) Refraction at a plane surface|refracts]] when it enters the optical fibre at one end.
- It undergoes repeated total internal reflection against the sides of the fibre until it reaches the other end, where it is refracted back out.

In this process, the light signals travel long distances without losing information or speed.

They have many uses, including:
- Communications, such as telephone and internet transmission
- Medical imaging, such as endoscopes

##### Components of optical fibres
The three main components of optical fibres are:
- An optically dense core tube, made of very pure plastic or glass
	- The medium must be very pure to reduce attenuation. It has very low absorption.
- A lower optically dense cladding surrounding the core
- An outer sheath

> [!NOTE] Step-index fibre
> This type of optical fibre is called a **step-index fibre** because the [[3.2.3(a) Refraction at a plane surface#Refractive index|refractive index]] of each component increases moving from the outside to the centre of the fibre

The role of the cladding is to:
- Ensure that total internal reflection can occur by having a lower refractive index
- Protect the thin core from damage and scratching which prevents light leakage (light escaping the core) and signal degradation where information from the signal is lost
- It keeps the core separate from other fibres preventing information crossover
#### Material and modal dispersion
**Material dispersion** is when different [[3.1.1 Progressive waves|wavelengths]] of light travel at different speeds through the optical fibre material, leading to a separation of the wavelengths. Each wavelength of light travels at the same speed in a vacuum, but at different speeds in a medium.
- It can be prevented by using monochromatic (single-wavelength) light sources, such as lasers or by using wavelengths which have very little chromatic dispersion, such as infrared light in glass

**Modal dispersion** occurs when different light rays taking different paths through the fibre, which causes them to arrive at slightly different times.
- It can be prevented by using a core and cladding of almost identical refractive indices. Another way is to keep the core of the fibre as narrow as positive so that light can only take a few paths through the core, in a single-mode fibre.

#### Pulse broadening and absorption
Pulse broadening is the spreading out of a light pulse over time as it travels through an optical fibre, which reduces the quality of the signal and cause information to be lost.

Attenuation is the gradual loss of signal intensity as light travels through the optical fibre. It is measured in decibels (dB) or decibels per kilometer ($\text{dB km}^{-1}$). It can be caused by absorption, scattering, and imperfections in the fibre, as well as bending losses.

To reduce absorption:
- An extremely transparent core is used
- Optical fibre repeaters may be used to regenerate the pulse

To reduce pulse broadening:
- A single-mode fibre is used to reduce modal dispersion
- A monochromatic light source is used to reduce material dispersion
