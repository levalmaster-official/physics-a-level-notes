#### Interference
When two or more waves arrive at the same point and overlap, their amplitudes combine. This is called [[3.1.3(a) Principle of superposition of waves|superposition]]. It produces areas of zero displacement and of increased displacement.

**Interference** is a specific outcome of superposition, where two or more coherent waves combine in a consistent way to produce a pattern of reinforcement or cancellation.
- Constructive interference - when two waves meet in [[3.1.1 Progressive waves#Phase difference|phase]], the resultant amplitude is equal to the sum of the individual amplitudes (when a crest meets a crest or a trough meets a trough)
- Destructive interference - when two waves meet in [[3.1.1 Progressive waves#Phase difference|antiphase]], there is **zero** resultant displacement

##### Coherence
For waves to undergo interference, they must be **coherent**. Coherent light sources have the same frequency and a constant phase different.

Examples of interference from coherent light sources are:
- Monochromatic laser light. Other sources of light are non-coherent, so they produce white light.
- Sound waves of two nearby speakers emitting sound of the same frequency. Constructive interference occurs when the compressions and rarefactions from each line line up and the sound appears louder.
- Electromagnetic waves, e.g. microwaves

>[!DANGER] Safety issues with lasers
>Lasers produce a very high-energy beam of light. This intense beam can cause permanent eye damage or blindness.
>Therefore, certain precautions should be taken:
>- Never look directly at a laser or its reflection
>- Do not allow a laser beam to reflect
>- Wear laser safety goggles

##### Path difference
Path difference is the difference in distance travelled by two waves from their sources to the point where they meet.

>[!QUESTION] What is the difference between path difference and phase difference?
>Path difference compares the amount of progress made by waves along a path. Phase difference on the other hand, compares the distance between the phases of coherent waves that are normally travelling parallel to each other at a point.

The path difference between two coherent waves determines whether there is constructive or destructive interference where they meet.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Path difference} = n\lambda, \text{where } n \in \mathbb{N} \quad \therefore \text{ Constructive interference occurs} \\[3mm]
\text{Path difference} = \left(n +\frac{1}{2}\right)\lambda, \text{where } n \in \mathbb{N} \quad \therefore \text{ Destructive interference occurs}
\end{aligned}
$$
>[!INFO] Path difference is **closely related** to phase difference
>The phase of a wave depends on the distance it has travelled. Therefore:
>$$
>\text{Path difference } (\lambda) = 2\pi \times \text{phase difference}
>$$
This means that constructive interference occurs where the phase difference is an even multiple of $\pi$ radians, and destructive interference occurs when the phase difference is an odd multiple of $\pi$ radians.
##### Wavefront diagrams
Wave behaviour can be shown by a wavefront diagram. A curved line represents each wavefront (peak or trough). This can show the interference between waves more clearly.
