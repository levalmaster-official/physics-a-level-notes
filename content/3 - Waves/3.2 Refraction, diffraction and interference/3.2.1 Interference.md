- Diffraction - the spreading of light as it passes through a gap or by an edge
- The greatest diffraction occurs when the size of the gap is equal to the wavelength

##### Coherence

##### Young's Double Slit experiment

When one waveform on a medium meets another waveform travelling across the same medium, we say that the two waves **interfere** as they pass through each other.

##### Fringe spacing
The equation for the distance between fringes caused by diffraction is:
$$w = \frac{\lambda D}{s}$$
where $w$ is fringe width, $D$ is distance between sources and $s$ is the separation.
