#### Diffraction
Diffraction is the spreading out of waves as they pass through a narrow gap (or aperture) or around an obstruction, into the region of the *geometrical shadow*.
![[Pasted image 20241217154222.png|centre|500]]

The greatest diffraction (when it is most prominent) occurs when the size of the gap is equal to the wavelength. This is because the wave spreads out most effectively when the gap size matches the natural scale of the wave's oscillation.

>[!INFO]- But *why* does diffraction occur?
>Huygens' Principle states that every point on a wavefront acts as a source of secondary spherical wavelets. The new wavefront is the result of the superposition of these wavelets.
>- When a wave passes through a narrow gap or around an obstacle, the wavefront cannot continue uninterrupted. 
>- The edges of the gap or obstacle act as sources of secondary wavelets which radiate outward.
>- These wavelets overlap and interfere, creating a new wavefront that spreads out beyond the boundaries of the gap.

Diffracted waves spread out more if:
- The gap is made narrower, or
- The wavelength is made larger
If diffracted waves spread out more, then the intensity of the maxima will decrease.

After passing through a gap:
- The waves spread out so they have curvature
- The amplitude of the wave is less because the barrier on either side of the gap absorbs wave energy

The only property of a wave that changes when it diffracts is its amplitude. The wavelength of the wave remains the same.

##### Single slit monochromatic diffraction pattern
The diffraction pattern of light passing through a single slit is a series of light and dark fringes on a screen.
- The bright fringes are areas of maximum intensity, produced by constructive interference of each part of the wavefront as it passes through the slit.
- The dark fringes are areas of zero or minimum intensity, produced by the destructive interference of each part of the wavefront as it passes through the slit.

>[!WARNING] Do not confuse with [[3.2.1(b) Young's double-slit experiment|double slit]] diffraction patterns
>There are a few differences between single slit and double slit diffraction patterns:
>- The central maximum for a single slit diffraction pattern is twice as wide as the other fringes. The intensity of the maxima decreases moving from the central maximum ()
>  - The intensity

Key features of diffraction of monochromatic light by a single slit:
- The central maximum is twice as wide than that of the double-slit diffraction pattern. It is wider and brighter than the other bright fringes.
- Each of the outer fringes is the same width
- On either side of the wide central maxima are much narrower and less bright maxima, that get dimmer as the order increases. The peak intensity of each fringe decreases with distance from the centre.

##### Single slit white light diffraction pattern
A source of white light diffracted through a single slit will produce the following diffraction pattern.
- The central maximum is bright white because constructive interference from all the colours happens here. It is much wider and brighter than the other fringes and much wider than that of the double-slit diffraction pattern.
- All other maxima are composed of a spectrum. Separate diffraction patterns can be observed for each wavelength of light.

#### Diffraction grating
A diffraction grating consists of plate with many closely spaced parallel slits ruled on it. When a parallel beam of monochromatic light is directly normally at a diffraction grating, light is transmitted by the grating in certain directions only. This is because:

- Diffraction: the light passing through each slit is diffracted
- Interference: the diffracted angle waves from adjacent slits reinforce each other in certain directions only, including the incident light direction, and cancel out in all other directions.

The central beam, referred to as the **zero order beam**, is in the same direction as the incident beam. The other transmitted beams are numbered outwards from the zero order beam. The angle of diffraction between each transmitted beam and the central beam increases if:
- The light of a longer wavelength is used
- A grating with closer slits are used.

Diffraction gratings are useful because they create a sharper pattern than a double slit. This means their bright fringes are narrower and brighter, while they dark regions are wider and darker.

##### Equation for maxima of a diffraction grating
The regions where constructive interference occurs are also the regions of maximum intensity. Their location can be calculated using the diffraction grating equation:
$$
n\lambda = d \sin\theta
$$
Where:
- $n$ is the order of the maximum
- $\lambda$ is the wavelength of light
- $d$ is the slit spacing
- $\theta$ is the angle of diffraction

The equation can be derived as following:
$$
\begin{align}
\text{Path difference} = d \sin \theta \\[3mm]      
\text{If path difference} = n\lambda, \text{ then constructive interference occurs} \\[3mm]        
\therefore d \sin \theta = n \lambda \\[3mm]
\end{align}
$$![[Pasted image 20241218094339.png|centre|500]]
>[!INFO] Maximum number of slits
> Since $\sin \theta$ can only be between 0 and 1, there is a limited number of maxima that can be produced. The number of slits per metre is given by the equation: $N = \frac{1}{d}$, and the maximum number of orders is given by the equation $n = \frac{d}{\lambda}$, rounded down to the nearest whole number.

##### Applications of diffraction gratings
Diffraction gratings are commonly used for spectroscopic dispersion and analysis of light.
- Light from stars can be split up using a diffraction grating to get a line absorption spectrum, which can be used to show the elements present
- X-ray crystallography, where x-rays are directed at a thin crystal sheet which acts as a diffraction grating to form a diffraction pattern. This is because the wavelength of x-rays is similar in size to the gaps between the atoms. This diffraction pattern can be used to measure the atomic spacing in certain materials.
