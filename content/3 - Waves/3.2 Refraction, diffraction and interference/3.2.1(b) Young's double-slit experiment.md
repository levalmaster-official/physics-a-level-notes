#### Young's double-slit experiment
Young's double-slit experiment produces a **diffraction** and an **interference pattern** using either:
- The interference of two **coherent** wave sources 
- A single wave source passing through a **double slit**

In the following set up for Young's double slit experiment: the laser light source is placed behind the single slit, so the light is diffracted, producing two light sources at slits A and B. The light from the double slits is then diffracted, producing a diffraction pattern made up of bright and dark fringes on a screen.

The **diffraction pattern** from the interference of the two sources can be seen on the screen when it is placed far away
- [[3.2.1(a) Interference#Interference|Constructive interference]] between light rays forms bright strips, also called **fringes**, interference fringes or maxima, on the screen
- [[3.2.1(a) Interference#Interference|Destructive interference]]  forms dark strips, also called dark fringes or minima, on the screen

Each bright fringe is identical and has the same width and intensity. They are all peaks of equal maximum intensity. The fringes are all separated by dark narrow bands of destructive interference, which are troughs of zero intensity.
#### Fringe spacing
The equation for the distance between fringes caused by diffraction is:
$$w = \frac{\lambda D}{s}$$
where $w$ is fringe width, $D$ is distance between sources and $s$ is the separation.

#### Production of interference patterns using white light
A source of white light diffracted through a double slit will produce the following diffraction pattern:
![[Pasted image 20241217153641.png|centre|400]]
It is different to that produced by a single slit or a diffraction grating. Each maximum is of roughly equal width. The central maximum is white because each wavelength interferes here constructively, and there are two dark narrow destructive interference fringes on either side. All other maxima are composed of a spectrum, where separate diffraction patterns can be observed for each wavelength of light.
- The shortest wavelength (violet/blue) would appear nearest to the central maximum because it is diffracted the least.
- The longest wavelength (red) would appear furthest from the central maximum because it is diffracted the most.
The colours look blurry and further away from the central maximum, the fringe spacing gets so small that the spectra eventually merge without any space between them. 
#### Developing Theories of EM Radiation

**Isaac Newton (1672)**

- Newton proposed that visible light is a stream of microscopic particles called **corpuscles**
- However, these corpuscles could not explain interference or diffraction effects, therefore, the view of light as a wave was adopted instead

**Christiaan Huygens (1678)**

- Huygens came up with the original **Wave Theory of Light** to explain the phenomena of diffraction and refraction
- This theory describes light as a series of wavefronts on which every point is a source of waves that spread out and travel at the same speed as the source wave
    - These are known as **Huygens' wavelets**

**Thomas Young (1801)**
- Young devised the famous **double-slit experiment**
- This provided experimental proof that light is a wave that can undergo constructive and destructive interference

>[!INFO] Evidence for the wave nature of light diffraction and interference was provided by Young's double slit experiment because are wave properties, and so proved that EM radiation must act as a wave

**James Clerk Maxwell (1862)**

- Maxwell showed that electric and magnetic fields obeyed the wave equation. This means that light was simply waves made up of electric and magnetic fields travelling perpendicular to one another
- Later, Maxwell and Hertz discovered the full **electromagnetic spectrum**

**Albert Einstein (1905)**

- Einstein discovered that light behaves as a particle, as demonstrated by the **photoelectric effect**
- He described light in terms of packets of energy called **photons**
- Later the scientific community came to understand that light behaves both like a wave and a particle
    - This is known as **wave-particle duality**
