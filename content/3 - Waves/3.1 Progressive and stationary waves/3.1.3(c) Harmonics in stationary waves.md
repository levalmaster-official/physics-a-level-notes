[[3.1.3(b) Formation of stationary waves#Stationary waves|Stationary waves]] can have different wave patterns, known as **harmonics**. These depend on the [[3.1.1 Progressive waves|frequency]] of the vibration.

- They can be observed on a string with two fixed ends.
- As the frequency is increased, more harmonics begin to appear

#### Harmonics on a string
When a stationary wave, such as a vibrating string, is fixed at both ends, the simplest wave pattern is a single loop made up of two nodes and an antinode. This is known as the **first harmonic**.

The particular frequencies (i.e. resonant frequencies) of stationary waves formed depend on the length of the string $L$ and the wave speed $v$. 
- The frequencies can be calculated from the string length and wave equation. 
- For a string of length $L$, the wavelength of the lowest harmonic is $2L$. This is because there is only one loop of the stationary wave, which is a half wavelength.

Therefore, the equation for the frequency of the first harmonic is:
$$
\begin{aligned}
f_1 &= \frac{v}{\lambda}, \\[3mm]
\lambda &= 2L \quad \text{(for the first harmonic)}, \\[3mm]
f_1 &= \frac{v}{2L}, \\[3mm]
v &= \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}, \\[3mm]
f_1 &= \frac{1}{2L} \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}
\end{aligned}
$$
##### $\text{N}^{\text{th}}$ harmonic
- The second harmonic has three nodes and two antinodes.
- The wavelength is $L$ and the frequency is equal to:
$$ \begin{aligned} f_2 &= \frac{v}{\lambda},\quad \lambda = L \quad \text{(for the second harmonic)}, \quad f_2 = \frac{v}{L}, \\[3mm] f_{2} &= 2f_{1}\end{aligned} $$
- The third harmonic has four nodes and three antinodes
- The wavelength is $\frac{2L}{3}$ and the frequency is equal to:
$$ \begin{aligned} f_3 &= \frac{v}{\lambda},\quad \lambda = \frac{2L}{3} \quad \text{(for the third harmonic)}, \quad f_3 = \frac{3v}{2L}, \\[3mm] f_{3} &= 3f_{1}\end{aligned} $$

Therefore, the $n$th harmonic has $n$ antinodes and $n+1$ nodes.
$$\text{nth harmonic the frequency} = n \times \text{frequency of first harmonic}$$
