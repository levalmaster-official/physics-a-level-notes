#### Stationary waves
- Stationary waves - waves that remain in a fixed position, without transferring energy through the medium.
	- Stationary waves **store** energy, unlike progressive waves which **transfer** energy
- They are formed by the [[3.1.3(a) Principle of superposition of waves|superposition]] of two waves of the same [[3.1.1 Progressive waves|frequency]] and [[3.1.1 Progressive waves|amplitude]] travelling in opposite directions.

#### Comparing progressive and stationary waves
|                  | Progressive waves                                                          | Stationary waves                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Frequency        | Every particle moves up and down at the same frequency                     | Every particle moves up and down at the same frequency, except nodes (0 Hz)                               |
| Amplitude        | Every particle reaches the same maximum amploitude                         | Every particle has its own maximum amplitude                                                              |
| Phase difference | Points exactly a wavelength apart are in phase<br>$\frac{2\pi d}{\lambda}$ | Any two points in the same loop have a phase difference of 0. In adjacent loops, points are in antiphase. |
| Energy transfer  | Transfers energy                                                           | Stores energy                                                                                             |

#### Antinodes and nodes
- Stationary waves are made up of nodes and antinodes
- Nodes - points of zero amplitude where destructive interference occurs. No oscillation occurs
- Antinodes - points of maximum amplitude where constructive interference occurs. These points oscillate with maximum energy
$$\text{Distance between adjacent nodes} = \frac{1}{2}\lambda$$
- They do no move along the string (horizontally)

#### Formation of stationary waves

1. Two waves of the same frequency, amplitude and speed travel in opposite directions
2. The waves interfere through superposition, leading to alternating regions of constructive and destructive interference
3. This creates a wave pattern with fixed nodes and antinodes

##### Examples of stationary waves

> [!INFO] Extra information
> Examples of stationary waves are **not** required to be known, however they may appear in exam questions.
###### 1. Stretched strings
- Vibrations caused by stationary waves on a stretched string produce sound. This is how stringed instruments, such as guitars or violins, work.
- At specific frequencies, known as **resonant frequencies**, a whole number of half wavelengths will fit on the length of the string
- As the resonant frequencies of the oscillator are achieved, standing waves with different numbers of minima (nodes) and maxima (antinodes) form

###### 2. Microwaves
- At specific frequencies, known as **resonant frequencies**, a whole number of half wavelengths will fit on the length of the string
- As the resonant frequencies of the oscillator are achieved, standing waves with different numbers of minima (nodes) and maxima (antinodes) form
###### 3. Sound waves
- Sound waves can be produced as a result of the formation of stationary waves inside an air column. This is how musical instruments, such as clarinets and organs, work.
