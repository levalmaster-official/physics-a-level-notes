Specification reference: [[AQA Physics Specification#3.1.3 Principle of superposition of waves and formation of stationary waves|3.1.3 Principle of superposition of waves and formation of stationary waves]]

Waves **superpose** when they meet, combining for an instant, and either constructive or destructive interference occurs.

> [!NOTE] The principle of superposition
> When two or more waves of the same type meet in one place, the total displacement at a point is equal to the vector sum of the individual displacements at that point

- Constructive interference - when two waves meet in phase, the resultant amplitude is equal to the sum of the individual amplitudes (when a crest meets a crest or a trough meets a trough)

- Destructive interference - when two waves meet in antiphase, there is **zero** resultant displacement
