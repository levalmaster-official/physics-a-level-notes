#### First law of motion
Newton's first law states that an object will stay at rest, or move with constant velocity, unless acted upon by an external resultant force.

$$
\overline{F}_{R} =0 \implies \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = 0
$$

#### Second law of motion
Newton's second law states that the acceleration of an object (of constant mass) is directly proportional to the external resultant force acting on the object.

$$
\overline{F}_{R} = m\overline{a}
$$

#### Third law of motion
Newton's third law states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. This means that if <span style='color:008ae6;'>object A</span> exerts a force on <span style='color:29a329;'>object B</span>, then <span style='color:29a329;'>object B</span> must exert the same type of force of equal magnitude but in the opposite direction back on <span style='color:008ae6;'>object A</span>.
