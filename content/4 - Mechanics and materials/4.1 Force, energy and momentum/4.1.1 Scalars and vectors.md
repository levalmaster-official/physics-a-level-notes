#### Scalars and vectors
Scalars are quantities that have **magnitude** but not direction. For example, mass is a scalar quantity.

Vectors are quantities that have both **magnitude** and **direction**. For example, weight is a vector quantity because it is a force and has both magnitude and direction.

##### Examples of scalars and vectors

| **Scalars** | **Vectors**  |
|:-----------:|:------------:|
|  distance   | displacement |
|    speed    |   velocity   |
|    mass     | acceleration |
|    time     |    force     |
|   energy    |   momentum   |
###### Distance and displacement

Displacement is a vector quantity while distance is a scalar quantity

- Distance is a measure of how far an object has travelled. It is the total length of the path taken and has no direction. Therefore it is a scalar quantity.
- Displacement is a measure of how far it is between two points in space, including the direction. It is a vector quantity.
###### Velocity and speed

Velocity is a vector quantity while speed is a scalar quantity

- Speed is a measure of the distance travelled by an object per unit time, so speed is a scalar quantity.
- Velocity is a measure of the displacement of an object per unit time, so velocity is a vector quantity.
#### Combining vectors

Vectors are represented by an arrow
- The arrowhead indicates the direction of the vector
- The length of the arrow represents the magnitude

Vectors can be combined by adding them to produce the resultant vector. The resultant vector is the net force experienced.


> [!NOTE] Combining vectors
> - Pythagoras' Theorem can be used to find the magnitude of the resultant vector.
> - Trigonometry can be used to find the direction of the resultant vector.
> - A scale drawing can also be used for addition

#### Resolving vectors
Resolving a vector is representing a single resultant vector by two vectors (usually at right angles to one another), which in combination have the same effect as the original. It is the opposite of [[#Combining vectors|combining vectors]].

- When a single resultant vector is broken down into its parts, those parts are called **components**
##### Equilibrium
Forces are in equilibrium when the resultant force is 0. This means that the object is either:
1. At rest
2. Moving at a constant velocity

Coplanar forces are forces which act on the same plane. They can be represented by vector triangles. 

In equilibrium, coplanar forces are represented by closed vector triangles. The addition of the vectors end up at the **starting** position.

The normal contact force **always** acts at 90 degrees to the surface of a plane. This means that it may not be opposite to the weight, for example in a sliding object.

perpendicular to the plane ($N$), the downward force of gravity ($mg$) and a force $f$ along the direction of the plane that could be applied, for example, by friction or a string.

When determining whether a set of **three coplanar forces** can combine to produce a resultant force of 0, remember that coplanar forces in equilibrium form a closed vector triangle. This means that the **triangle inequality theorem** can be applied to check if a triangle can be formed using the three vectors.

The **triangle inequality theorem** states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. Mathematically, for side lengths $a$, $b$ and $c$:

1. $a + b > c$
2. $a + c > b$
3. $b + c > a$

If any of these conditions are not satisfied, a triangle cannot be formed and the forces *cannot* be in equilibrium.
