#### Density
Density is the mass per unit volume of an object. Its units are $\text{kg m}^{-3}$.

$$\rho = \frac{m}{v}$$
### Stretched wires
#### Hooke's law

Hooke's law states that the force needed to stretch a spring is directly proportional to the extension of the spring from its natural length.

It can be expressed in the equation $$F = k\Delta L$$
where $k$ is the spring constant, measured in $\text{N m}^-1$, which describes how stiff a spring is, and $\Delta L$ is the extension of the spring.
#### Force-extension graphs

- Limit of proportionality - the point after which Hooke's law is no longer obeyed
- Elastic limit - the maximum stress a material can withstand and still return to its original dimensions (before plastic deformation will occur)
- Elastic deformation - when an object returns to its original dimensions after the deforming force is removed.
- Plastic deformation - when an object does not return to its original dimensions after the deforming force is removed.

##### Springs in parallel
For springs in parallel, the force exerted is distributed across the springs. The effective spring constant is:  $k_{e}= k_{P} + k_{Q}$  for springs P and Q.
##### Springs in series
For springs in a series, a weight is supported by two springs joined end on with each other. The tension in each spring is equal and equal to the weight. The effective spring constant is: $$\frac{1}{K_{e}} = \frac{1}{k_{P}} + \frac{1}{k_{Q}}$$
#### Elastic strain energy
Work has to be done to stretch a material. Before a material reaches its elastic limit, all the work is done is stored as elastic strain energy.

The equation for elastic strain energy is:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Elastic strain energy} &= \text{Area under force-extension graph}, \\[3mm]
&= \frac{1}{2} F \Delta L \quad \text{(for a material obeying Hooke's law)}, \\[5mm]
F = k \Delta L, \quad E &= \frac{1}{2}k {\Delta L}^{2}\quad \text{(for a material obeying Hooke's law)}
\end{aligned}
$$
##### Conservation of energy
###### Loading and unloading a metal wire
When a metal wire is loaded with a force and stretched beyond its limit of proportionality, it will undergo plastic deformation. When the force is removed, the wire is unloaded, This causes the extension to decrease. The unloading line is parallel to the loading line (since k does not change), however, it does not go through the origin.

> [!QUESTION] Why does the unloading line not go through the origin?
> If the wire is permanently deformed, it will not be at zero extension when there is no force as it is now permanently extended. 

The area between the loading and unloading lines represents the **work done** to permanently deform the wire.

###### Loading and unloading a rubber 
- The force-extension graph for a material may not always be the same when loading (adding a force) and unloading (removing a force), if the material does not follow Hooke's Law.
- The force-extension curve for stretching and contracting a rubber band is shown below:
![[Pasted image 20241204204934.png | centre | 400]]

- The unloading curve goes through the origin. This means that there is no permanent extension, and that the rubber band is elastic.
- The area under the unloading curve is the work done by the rubber when it is returned to its original shape
- The area under the loading curve is the work done in stretching the rubber band originally

>[!QUESTION] What does the area between the loading and unloading curves represent?
> It is the work done in heating the rubber. The rubber band becomes warm when it is contracted, hence some energy is transferred to heat energy (as polymer chains contract as release stored elastic strain energy).
###### Energy conservation issues
- Vehicle suspension systems are made up of tires, springs and shock absorbers, which provide comfortable handling of a vehicle and improve the comfort of passengers by absorbing **impact forces**.
- When a vehicle hits a bump in the road, the shock absorbers convert kinetic energy from the movement of the car, into thermal energy which is dissipated.
- The fast the springs in the suspension system move, the more resistance the shock absorber providers.
#### Stress-strain curves

> [!INFO] Background information
> Opposite forces can deform an object. If the forces stretch the object, then they are [[4.2.2 The Young modulus#Tensile force|tensile forces]]. Tensile forces lead to the two properties of materials known as tensile stress and tensile strain.

Stress and strain can be plotted on a graph known as a stress-stress curve.
![[Pasted image 20241205043535.png| centre | 500]]
- Stress-strain curves describe the properties of materials, such as whether they are brittle, ductile, and up to what stress and strain they obey Hooke's Law and have elastic and/or plastic behaviour.
- The **ultimate tensile stress** is the maximum force per original cross-sectional area a wire is able to support until it breaks.

![[Pasted image 20241204201753.png | centre | 500]]

- Yield stress - the force per unit area at which the material extends plastically for no/a small increase in stress.
- The elastic strain energy stored per unit volume is the area under the Hooke's Law region of the graph..
- Breaking point - the stress at this point is the breaking stress. This is the maximum stress a material can stand before it fractures.
	- A material with high breaking stress is considered ductile, which means it can extend more before breaking because of plastic deformation
- Elastic region - the region of the graph up till the elastic limit. In this region, the material will return to its original shape when the applied force is removed.
- Plastic region - the region of the graph after the elastic limit. In this region, the material has deformed permanently and will not return to its original shape when the applied force is removed.
	- Brittle materials have very little to no plastic region. The material breaks with little elastic deformation
	- Ductile materials have a much larger plastic region. The material stretches into a new shape before breaking.
