#### Tensile force
Tensile force is when a force stretches a material. We can say that the material is under tension.
	The opposite are compressive forces: when a force compresses a material.

Tensile stress is the force exerted per unit cross-sectional area of a material.
$$\sigma = \frac{T}{A}$$
Tensile strain is the deformation of an object under tensile stress, given as the extension per unit length.
$$\epsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L_{o}}$$
#### Young's modulus
The Young modulus ($E$) is the measure of the ability of a material to withstand changes in length with an added load. 
- The greater the Young's modulus, the less a material stretches or compresses under a given load, meaning that the material is **stiffer**.
- A smaller Young's modulus indicates the material deforms more easily, so the material is more flexible.
$$\text{Young modulus} = \frac{\text{tensile stress}} {\text{tensile strain}} = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon} = \frac{F \times L_o}{A\times \Delta L}$$

> [!NOTE] Units
> The units for tensile stress is Pascals (Pa). Tensile strain is dimensionless, because it is a ratio. Therefore, Young modulus is given in Pascals.

The Young Modulus is equal to the gradient of a [[4.2.1 Bulk properties of solids#Stress-strain curves|stress-strain graph]] when it is linear. This is the region in which [[4.2.1 Bulk properties of solids#Hooke's law|Hooke's law]] is obeyed. The area under the graph in this region is equal to the energy stored per unit volume of the material.
